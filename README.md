# Python_Challenge

The following challenge analyzes two scenarios where coding with Python can be useful in creating summary reports.

The first scenario "Pybank" analyzes the data of a large CSV file containing the dates and profit/losses of an account. After the analysis we obtain the total months, total profit, average change, greatest increase and greates decrease in profit.

For the second scenario "Pypoll", we obtain a large data bank on a CSV file for a small town election. This data was divided by voter ID, county and candidate. The analysis provided the election results with total votes, votes per candidate, and a winner display.
